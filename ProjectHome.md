One of the most commonly known attack is the ARP poisoning attack, this causes a lot of problems for people having a shared internet connection with script kiddies.

In Egypt, a very common approach people use to dominate the internet connection is to use "NetCut" (Arp Poisoner for Windows) and there are several anti-NetCut programs for windows but nothing for Linux. So I decided to write one...

The latest version from Antinetcut support all flavors of Unix/Linux and Mac OS X, so it's the only program that's available to protect against that specific ARP poisoning attack in all Unix/Linux platforms.

Antinetcut run as daemon and can be remotely controlled by XMLRPC, currently listening on the loopback interface only for in-machine control.
